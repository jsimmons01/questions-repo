# Questions-Repo

## Description 

Creating a FAQS page. I will have to use traversing of the DOM and using selectors. 

### What did I learn?

I learned how to toggle between showing text and two different buttons using traversing. Search for the parent element to toggle betwen the sections. This can be down with children as well.

I also used selectors. Select all the questions and within the questions access the button, then toggle.
### What could I do differently?
